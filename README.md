# Cache-Simulator
A Simple Cache Simulator - 

1. Currently supports a single level of cache(L1) - higher cache level support in progress
2. Only supports LRU replacement policy - more policies to be added
3. Constant miss penalty (L2 or memory latency agnostic) and constant write-back latency - queuing model to be supported later
4. Multi-core(SMP) and Coherency support to be added

More items:
1. Possible optimizations and newer C++ standards usage?
2. Possible parallelization using OpenMP?
